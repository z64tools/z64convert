# TPLink64Deluxe

This object serves as a relatively exhaustive stress test. It utilizes many of the most obscure (and therefore most likely to go undetected if they break) features in `z64convert`. A writeup discussing how involved these features are and how this model utilizes them can be found [here](https://holland.vg/post/tp-link-64-deluxe-source/) for those who are curious.

A successful test is characterized by program output with addresses similar to those in the original export for the TPLink64Deluxe mod. Identical output is preferred. **Larger output is a red flag.**

The data used for the test was exported from Blender using this specific version of the `io_export_objex` plugin: [GitHub - Dragorn421/io_export_objex at fe5aefa547b0116ef5dedc22f54648556352cae8](https://github.com/Dragorn421/io_export_objex/tree/fe5aefa547b0116ef5dedc22f54648556352cae8 "https://github.com/Dragorn421/io_export_objex/tree/fe5aefa547b0116ef5dedc22f54648556352cae8")

A big thank you to [@Zeldaboy14](https://github.com/Zeldaboy14) for preparing this export on such short notice!
